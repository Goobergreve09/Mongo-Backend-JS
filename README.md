## Description

This project was created to show functionality in the relationship between noSQL and MongoDB. A backend database was created for a social media API for users, thoughts for that user, and each thought could have a reaction from another user. Connecting to a local server and testing this through Insomnia to show it's functionality. Within Insomnia I could then View all users and thoughts, search a user and thought by id, update a thought and user, delete a thought and user, add and remove a friend, and lastly add and remove a reaction to a thought.
